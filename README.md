# Licking County Area Transportation Study (LCATS)

## Problem Statement

The primary objective of this project is to propose improvements to the transportation system in Licking County, specifically focusing on enhancing pedestrian and biker accessibility. Our aim is to identify and address key areas that can benefit from better roads, sidewalks, crosswalks, signage, or other infrastructural upgrades that will support the Granville community.

## Approach

To align with LCATS’ mission of ensuring that the transportation system in Licking County supports and encourages appropriate economic development and social activities, we prioritized locations with high pedestrian traffic and economic activity. We identified location H, at the intersection of Route 661 and the T.J. Evans bike trail, as the focal point for our analysis. This area is in close proximity to the Granville Farmers Market and River Road shops, and experiences an average of over 250 people passing through daily.

### Data Collection

Our data collection involved:
- Observing and surveying the physical layout of location H.
- Consulting with business owners in the River Road area for their input on potential improvements.
- Comparing pedestrian traffic at location H on Saturdays and Tuesdays with the operating hours of the Granville Farmers Market.
- Conducting statistical tests to determine the significance of traffic patterns on different days.

## Findings

Our analysis revealed that the peak traffic at location H on Saturdays coincides with the Farmers Market hours. However, the data for Tuesdays was less clear, and further data collection is needed to establish a definitive pattern.

### Statistical Analysis

We performed two statistical tests:
1. Comparing Sunday traffic with Saturday traffic.
2. Comparing Tuesday traffic with the mean weekday traffic.

Both tests resulted in p-values greater than 0.45, indicating no statistically significant difference. This suggests that more data collection is required for a conclusive analysis.

## Suggestions

Based on our findings, we propose the following improvements to support the Granville Farmers Market and local businesses:

1. **Increased Bike Parking**: Adding more bike parking in the Ross’ Granville Market parking lot to enhance accessibility for bikers, especially on Tuesdays.
2. **Sidewalk Construction**: Building a sidewalk along River Road to improve pedestrian and biker accessibility to the Saturday farmers market at Raccoon Valley Park and the River Road shops.
3. **Enhanced Signage**: Installing signs at the intersection of the T.J. Evans trail and Route 661 to display the Farmers Market hours and location. Additionally, providing directions to the Farmers Market and River Road shops.

These improvements will help create a more supportive transportation system that aligns with LCATS’ goals and benefits the local economy.

## Conclusion

Implementing these proposed changes will enhance pedestrian and biker accessibility, support local businesses, and align with the overall mission of LCATS. Continued data collection and analysis will be crucial to further refine these recommendations and ensure their effectiveness in improving the transportation infrastructure in Licking County.
